"""PROBE-94 (2026-08-20) -- the decisive bounded experiment of the
NATIVE-96 session, run under the locked bars' control-(0*) lineage in
the SCOUT'S direction (64 -> 96), because the native march measured a
real dA2/ds collapse (~6.5e-4 at A2 = 0.0048 to ~6.8e-5 at 0.0063,
member-grade solves, still decaying) that prices the native approach
to the third shared pin at 500-1000 arc steps.

THE QUESTION: does the aligned branch exist at 96 x 36 at the third
shared RAMP_CONV pin (A2 = 0.009396), where the FND-142 64 x 24 member
converged? Procedure is the registered FND-143 deviation verbatim:
regenerate the 64 x 24 member with stage 2's OWN code, chart-convert
and FFT-interpolate to 96 x 36 (angle-safe psit handling), and
re-solve ARC-ANCHORED at ds = 0 against the interpolated tangent, with
A2 measured into the 5e-3 drift gate rather than pinned (the a2 pin is
near-singular natively in this region -- the measured 64-round stall).

OUTCOME (a): converges nearby (drift < 5e-3, closure < 1e-6) -- the
branch exists natively at 0.0094; the march crawl is traversable
geometry; session verdict RATES-REGISTERED with a CI-resumable walk.
OUTCOME (b): fails to converge or drifts beyond the gate -- the 64-grid
contamination boundary sits near A2 ~ 0.006, far deeper than the
gamma = 0.558 the scout could see; FND-143 is strengthened and the
asymptote scenario leads for the Sigma_wave question.

Checkpoint: /tmp/p94_ckpt.pkl (separate from the march checkpoint,
which stays valid for CI resumption regardless of this outcome).

    #   (a) The cap is raised again on the same registered argument.
    #       The round-38 close-out left the floor still contracting
    #       ~7-8% per pair without decay, which is a budget state and
    #       not a bar state; 240 prices the uncapped finish of the
    #       contraction at the measured per-pair rate with headroom.
    #   (b) THE GUARD IS THE IMPORTANT PART. As written, exhausting
    #       the cap fell THROUGH to the verdict block and would have
    #       registered conf_verdict = 'failed' on a still-descending
    #       solve -- a budget adjudicated as a bar, which the house
    #       rules forbid and which would have mis-registered the
    #       decisive displacement-vs-progressive-exhaustion call.
    #       Cap exhaustion now exits NO-VERDICT and resumable, the
    #       same exit a chunk-end budget takes. Only a genuine
    #       stall (no step accepted) or the RMS bar adjudicates.

    # SCHEDULING FINDING (2026-08-21 session 3, measured, and it
    # REVERSES a registered instrument note): the earlier record
    # states that background processes die at the tool-call boundary,
    # which is why every previous stage-D chunk ran foreground with a
    # 200 s margin and ~1-3 rounds per call. Measured here: a run
    # launched under setsid with stdio redirected SURVIVES the
    # boundary and keeps running between calls. The uncapped finish
    # is therefore in-session work, not CI-only work. The per-round
    # save below is what makes that safe -- a detached run that is
    # reaped loses at most one round instead of the whole chunk.
    #
    # INCIDENT KEPT ON THE RECORD (2026-08-21 session 3): the first
    # detached run was REAPED at round 42, silently and with no
    # traceback -- the container's OOM signature, not a solver
    # failure. Cause: document work (pandoc, then soffice and the
    # diagram renderer for the plain-language guide rebuild) was run
    # in the SAME container while a stage-D round held ~2.7 GB of a
    # 4 GB budget. THE RULE THIS BUYS: a detached stage-D run is
    # MEMORY-EXCLUSIVE. While it is live, no soffice, no pandoc, no
    # second solve; monitoring commands only. The per-round save held
