"""COMMISSION NATIVE-96, 2026-08-20 -- the aligned-branch continuation
run NATIVELY at 96 x 36, executed under analysis/NATIVE96_bars_LOCKED.md
(which inherits TRAVERSE_bars_LOCKED.md in full and takes TRAVERSE-96's
finding as its reason to exist).

Nothing here is seeded, pinned or targeted by a 64 x 24 branch member.
Level-1 is built in closed form on the fine grid; the A2 ramp, the
tangent and the pseudo-arclength walk all run there. The 64-grid
appears in exactly one place, control (0*), where stage 2's OWN code
regenerates the mild ramp members as a resolution-consistency target.

THE ONE STRUCTURAL CHANGE from the inherited bars (bars delta 2): the
transverse and axial closure residuals are HALT-GRADE at 1e-6 on every
accepted point. In this chart they are equations, not identities; the
inherited bars printed them without gating, and that is precisely how
the 64 x 24 run carried aliased members under a clean field-RMS bar.

Solver ladder imported verbatim from traverse96_scout (float32 Jacobian
store, float64 criteria, damped GN with the measured damping floor, f64
dsyrk normal equations in the endgame, exact GN with line search at the
bottom).

Driver: --budget SECONDS chunks, rerun to resume. Checkpoint:
/tmp/n96_ckpt.pkl. --reset starts over.
