# How to Criticize the Rope Programme

This document exists because a programme that means its commitment to falsifiability
should tell critics exactly where to aim. It is written to make rigorous criticism
*easier*, not to preempt it.

## Where to look first (highest leverage)

1. **The load-bearing derivations.** Two theorems carry disproportionate weight:
   - the Gamma-convergence / homogenization result (FND-003/004), from which EM,
     thermodynamics, and condensed matter descend;
   - the gravity metric-order no-go (GRV-008 through GRV-020), on which the entire
     adverse gravity verdict rests.
   If either is wrong, a whole sector moves. These are the first targets, and they are
   the two slated for Lean formalization precisely so the algebra can be checked, not trusted.

2. **The single calibrated constants.** Several sectors rest on one fitted number:
   the nuclear mass predictor (NUC-005, one constant, C-12..U-238), the field-strain
   calibration SIGMA (EM-RECON-014). Attack the claim that ONE constant does the work --
   look for hidden second parameters.

3. **The adopted-vs-derived seams.** Wherever an equation is adopted (the Schrodinger
   form in chemistry; the electronegativity charge map; hybridization mixing), the
   "derivation" downstream inherits whatever that adoption smuggles in. These seams are
   labeled; test whether the label is honest.

## Which assumptions are load-bearing

- **Volume-conserving strands** (P-VOL) -- underlies the mechanical core.
- **The mesh scale as an irreducible input** -- the atomic-scale derivation is blocked here.
- **Preferred-frame (Lorentz-Poincare) relativity** -- transverse-only Lorentz invariance
  is emergent, not fundamental; a genuine test of isotropy stresses this.
- **Configuration counting** -- the choice that makes the model classical, and the reason
  entanglement is out of reach. This is THE load-bearing ontological commitment.

## What would falsify each sector

- **EM/optics:** the PVLAS-class birefringence discriminator -- rope predicts a 3:1
  negative-index shift where QED predicts 7:4 positive. A measurement in the window kills one.
- **Gravity:** already falsified classically; the quantum-completion conjecture (GRV-014)
  falls if its induced action does not produce the factor-of-4 correction.
- **Chemistry:** the heavy-hydride angles must approach 90 from ABOVE, never below
  (CHEM-GEO-002); a single sub-90-degree hydride (H2Po predicted 90.0-90.7) falsifies the
  phase-blocking mechanism. The metallic Na-vs-Cl2 discrimination must hold.
- **Nuclear:** the SEMF surface/volume ratio and shell structure must emerge together from
  the mode-capacity rebuild (NUC-006 next-order); if quantized bonds don't fix both, the
  bundle-contact picture is incomplete.

## Which benchmark failures would collapse entire sections

- If `verify_corpus.py` fails on the Gamma-convergence benchmarks -> EM, thermo, condensed
  matter lose their derived status simultaneously.
- If the Yukawa-from-overlap benchmark (NUC-004) fails -> the entire nuclear AND chemical
  bonding account (shared mechanism) is undermined at once.
- If the electrostatic-sign theorem (EM-015) is wrong -> ionic bonding, hydrogen bonding,
  and the Coulomb sign all fall together.

## Which derivations depend on adopted equations (trust-transitively)

- Everything in chemistry that uses absolute energies inherits the adopted Schrodinger
  scale -- these are "consistency-tier," not independent predictions.
- The hydrogen-bond and reaction-dynamics energies inherit the adopted electronegativity
  charge map, which the F/O miss identified as the sector's load-bearing flaw.

## The fastest disproof

If you can show that any ONE claim labeled "Derived" actually requires a hidden fitted
parameter, or that any "parameter-free" prediction was tuned post-hoc, you will have found
the failure mode the entire methodology is built to prevent -- and the registered
correction history (three refused rescues; four disclosed operator errors) is where to
check whether we have caught ourselves before.
